In our efforts to help the disabled it quickly became clear to us that seniors could also benefit from an affordable transportation service, that provides a higher level of care and attention.

Our drivers are screened with background checks, DOT level drug testing, and bonded for your safety. They are selected for their willingness and patience to give additional assistance needed for your independence!

Whether it is toting the weekly groceries, or the luggage at the airport, to your next adventure, let our drivers handle it for you. The small things “do” count; getting the doors, or having that “arm” for you, are part of Freedom Shuttle’s credo.

Let us help you with your mobility and transportation needs and daily independence.
